- [ ] New components integrate seamlessly
- [x] Build system updated correctly

## üìù Notes

### Implementation Guidelines
- Each component must pass clang-format before committing
- Use PIMPL idiom for all public classes
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Document all public interfaces
- **Use C++23 as default standard** (only use older C++ features when specifically needed for compatibility)
- **Current environment**: GCC 11.5, using C++17 for compatibility

### Risk Mitigation
- Test each component thoroughly before integration
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Use feature flags for gradual migration
- Monitor performance throughout implementation

### Compatibility Layer Design
- C++17 is the minimum supported standard for current environment
- C++23 features should be used when available (GCC 13+)
- Compatibility layer should provide fallbacks for older standards
- Use feature detection macros for conditional compilation
